# Array-Based Questions - Repository: 100DaysofDSA

## Description
Welcome to the 100DaysOfDSA repository! This repository is dedicated to improving your data structures and algorithms skills through daily practice.
In this README, we'll define arrays and mention that the folder contains array-based questions.

### Arrays:
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. 
It is used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are widely used in computer
programs to store similar types of data. In Java, arrays are objects, and they can be declared and initialized using square brackets [].

## Folder Content
This folder contains array-based questions that will help you enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of arrays.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance this repository are welcome! Feel free to add more array questions and solutions in Java. Just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.
