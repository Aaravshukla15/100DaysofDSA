// You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

// You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

// An integer x.
// Record a new score of x.
// '+'.
// Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
// 'D'.
// Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
// 'C'.
// Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
// Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

// The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.

// Example 1:
// Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
// Output: 30
