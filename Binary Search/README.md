# Binary Search in DSA

## Introduction

Welcome to the Binary Search subfolder of the **100 Days of DSA** challenge! This folder is dedicated to understanding and mastering the concept of Binary Search, a fundamental algorithm in the domain of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Whether you are a beginner or looking to strengthen your DSA skills, this resource will provide you with comprehensive insights into Binary Search and its applications.

## What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array or list. The primary condition for Binary Search to work is that the array (or list) must be sorted in ascending or descending order. The algorithm operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half. The process continues until the search key is found or the interval is empty.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `low` and `high`, representing the bounds of the search interval.
2. **Midpoint Calculation**: Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the interval.
3. **Comparison**:
    - If `arr[mid]` equals the target value, the search is successful.
    - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target value, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
    - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target value, adjust the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `low` is greater than `high` or the target value is found.

### Pseudocode:

```pseudo
function binarySearch(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = length(arr) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        else if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return -1  // Target not found
```

## Importance of Binary Search in DSA

Binary Search is crucial in the field of DSA for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: Binary Search significantly reduces the time complexity of search operations from O(n) in linear search to O(log n), making it ideal for large datasets.
2. **Foundation for Advanced Algorithms**: Many advanced algorithms and data structures, such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and binary heaps, are built on the principles of binary search.
3. **Practical Applications**: Binary Search is used in numerous practical applications, including dictionary search, database querying, and various search problems in competitive programming and real-world scenarios.
