#Question
Functions - Take this coding challenge to test your coding skills to

-define a function
-pass arguments by value to a function -pass arguments by reference to a function

This coding challenge is organized in the following way:

First line of input reads an integer to select the coding challenge:
-Reading value '1' selects the coding-challenge 1 ( tests the ability to define a function and pass arguments by value.)
- Reading value '2' selects the coding challenge 2 (tests the ability to pass arguments by reference to a function)

Coding Challenge -1
Define a function named "Maximum" that accepts two integers (pass by value) as arguments and returns the greatest of the two arguments.
