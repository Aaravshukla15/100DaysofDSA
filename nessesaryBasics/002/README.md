#Question-1 
The n-th term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n-2)
Where, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1,
Provided 'n' you have to find out the n-th FibonacciNumber. Handle edges cases like when 'n' = 1 or 'n' = 2 by using conditionals 
like if else and return what'sexpected.
