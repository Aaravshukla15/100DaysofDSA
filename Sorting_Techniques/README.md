# Sorting Techniques in Data Structures and Algorithms

Sorting is a fundamental operation in data structures and algorithms (DSA). It involves arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. There are various basic sorting techniques, each with advantages and use cases. Here are some standard sorting techniques and their types:

## Bubble Sort
- Description: Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- How it works: It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order until no more swaps are needed.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

## Selection Sort
- Description: Selection sort is another simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- How it works: It divides the input list into sorted and unsorted sublists, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist, and moves it to the sorted sublist.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

## Insertion Sort
- Description: Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
- How it works: It builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each piece into its correct position within the sorted part of the array.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

## Merge Sort
- Description: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- How it works: It recursively divides the unsorted list into sublists and merges them until a sorted list is obtained.
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(n).

## Quick Sort
- Description: Quick sort is another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- How it works: It selects a pivot element, partitions the list into smaller and larger elements, and recursively sorts the partitions.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case (with poor pivot selection), but typically O(n log n).
- Space Complexity: O(log n).

Each sorting technique has its characteristics, making it suitable for different scenarios. The choice of sorting algorithm should consider factors like the size of the data set, range of values, and desired performance characteristics.
