# 100DaysofDSA - String-Based Questions

Welcome to the 100DaysOfDSA repository! This repository is dedicated to improving your data structures and algorithms
skills through daily practice. In this README, we'll define strings and mention that the folder contains string-based questions.

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. In most programming languages,
strings are represented as arrays of characters. They are used extensively in programming for text processing, manipulation, and storage.

## Folder Content

This folder contains string-based questions that will help you enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding of string 
manipulation techniques.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance this repository are welcome! Feel free to add more string questions and solutions in your preferred programming language.
Just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines.
